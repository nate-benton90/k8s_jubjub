# Welcome to the so-called "K8s JubJub"

- **Side note**: so, what is "JubJub"...? Visit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/9dqzvg/jub_jub/) to
get the idea. Still confused? Great, you're in the right place :confused: :smile:.

## Container preface:
* With most content related to Kubernetes (i.e. "k8s", especially intro material), there's always this corresponding,
obligatory opening and explanation of containers (which Docker is now - to me, unfortunately - synonmous with) and then
some hand-wavy, lacking, and quasi-illustration of virtual machines (i.e. VMs) and thier difference to containers. If
you want to dig into Docker, go for it, but that's not what I'm going to breifly describe here. For this, I just want
to make the point that Docker is indeed container technology, _but_ not not **all** containers (and the apps that run
within them) are just Docker-backed. If you're looking for some real, granular, and (to me) black hole collatory knowledge
opporunities, visit and watch/read from the following two links: 1] [cgroups, namespace, ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK5i-N34im8&list=LL&index=93&t=647s)
and 2] [how containers work](https://wizardzines.com/zines/containers/) (**ps**: yes, you certainly should pay for the full
PDF, it's great!)
